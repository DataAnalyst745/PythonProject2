# Student Test Scores Dataset

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains scores from three tests (math, reading, and writing) for students at a fictional public school. In addition to the test scores, it includes various personal and socio-economic factors that may interact with or influence the test scores.

**Remark/Warning/Disclaimer:**

- This dataset is fictional and is intended solely for educational purposes.
- The dataset was generated by Mr. Royce Kimmons.
- While similar datasets are available on Kaggle, this dataset offers unique advantages:
  - **Larger Size:** Contains over 30,000 records compared to the 1,000 records in other datasets.
  - **Extended Features:** Includes 15 features (as opposed to 9 in other datasets) and contains missing values, making it particularly useful for data cleaning and preprocessing exercises.

## Data Dictionary

Here is a description of each column in the dataset:

- **Gender:** Gender of the student (`male`, `female`)
- **EthnicGroup:** Ethnic group of the student (`group A` to `group E`)
- **ParentEduc:** Parent(s)' education background (`some_highschool` to `master's degree`)
- **LunchType:** Type of school lunch (`standard`, `free/reduced`)
- **TestPrep:** Whether a test preparation course was followed (`completed`, `none`)
- **ParentMaritalStatus:** Parent(s)' marital status (`married`, `single`, `widowed`, `divorced`)
- **PracticeSport:** Frequency of sports practice (`never`, `sometimes`, `regularly`)
- **IsFirstChild:** Whether the student is the first child in the family (`yes`, `no`)
- **NrSiblings:** Number of siblings the student has (`0` to `7`)
- **TransportMeans:** Means of transport to school (`schoolbus`, `private`)
- **WklyStudyHours:** Weekly self-study hours (`less than 5hrs`, `between 5 and 10hrs`, `more than 10hrs`)
- **MathScore:** Math test score (`0` to `100`)
- **ReadingScore:** Reading test score (`0` to `100`)
- **WritingScore:** Writing test score (`0` to `100`)

## Analytics Questions

1. **What factors (features) affect test scores the most?**
2. **Are there interacting features that affect test scores?**

## Usage

This dataset is designed for educational use and can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The dataset includes missing values, which provide opportunities to practice data imputation and cleaning techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the relationships between features and test scores.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models to predict test scores or classify student performance based on various features.
